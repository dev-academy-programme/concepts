Integration testing is the process of testing how all your different units are working in concert.

Often with integration testing on the client side, this involves spinning up a browser and automating clicking.
Clicks and other browser actions are usually automated using a tool called Selenium as a driver (this is common across programming languages).

There are many packages which you can use to write tests which drive Selenium.
Examples of integrationg test frameworks that js:
  - [Nightwatch](http://nightwatchjs.org)
  - [Pioneer.js](http://pioneerjs.com/)

These can take a bit of configuring, so it's worth shopping around and seeing what the best practice is before choosing a technology (this can change from year to year).
