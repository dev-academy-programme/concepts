# Integration Testing

[Integration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing) is the process of testing how all your different modules are working in concert.

Client-side integration testing involves automating a browser and instructing it to visit specific pages, fill in fields and click on buttons in specified steps.

Most client-side tests use a tool called [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) to automate the browser (this is common across programming languages).

JavaScript packages which you can use to write tests which drive Selenium include:
  - [Nightwatch](http://nightwatchjs.org)
  - [Pioneer.js](http://pioneerjs.com/)
  - [Chimp](https://chimp.readme.io/)

These can take a bit of configuring, so it's worth shopping around and seeing what the best practice is before choosing a technology (this can change from year to year).
