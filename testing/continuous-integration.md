# Continuous Integration (CI)

CI is an activity that is continuously integrating work as you go. Adding small pieces often, and running tests as you go means you know early when there are problems, and can resolve it shortly after you encounter them. The inverse would be to build a monolithic feature, then try to integrate it in an hope for the best.

There are many services that support CI, and do fancy things like auto-run all your tests every time you open a pull request.

Examples :
- Travis CI
- Circle CI
- Jenkins
