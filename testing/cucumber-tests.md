# Cucumber Tests

Cucumber is a flavour of integration tests that aim to improve collaboration between technical and non-technical people in developing software. 

Tests are written in [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference) which means that:
  * tests are human readable - people without technical understanding can participate directly in reading and writing tests
  * tests can clarify what the software should do from a user's perspective
  * tests follow a familiar pattern analogous to that of unit testing:  Given (arrange), When (act) Then (assert), and 
  * tests can be linked directly to the the team and client's broader intentions for the software such as User Stories or [Jobs-to-be-done](https://blog.intercom.io/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/)


## Cucumber in a Behaviour-driven Development (BDD) cycle

A Behaviour-driven Development cycle that uses Cucumber might follow the following steps.


### 1. Intention clarification (user stories / jobs to be done)

At this stage the client and software team clarify the problems that the user faces and how the software assists them. 

For example, for a weather app we may define a User Story as the following:

```yml
As a User,
I want to view the likelihood of rain for my GPS coordinates
So that, when I go outside I know whether or not I need to take my jacket
```

We could re-write the same intention as a Job Story like so:

```yml
When I am planning my lunch date, 
I want to check the likelihood of rain, 
So I know whether or not to take my jacket
```

Most people use user stories, but either is fine. 


### 2. Gherkin feature specification

Once we have clarified the intentions we can begin "speccing out" how users will flow through the app and how particular software features will meet the user's needs. 

Gherkin syntax follows the [Given, When, Then](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Given-When-Then) steps. "Given" steps put the app into a particular state (on a particular page, signed-in, signed-out etc). "When" refers to actions the user takes (clicking a button etc). "Then" refers to the expected outcomes (updated information, notifications etc).

Often the development team and the client do this in conjunction with creating mockups or a clickable UI prototype using [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/), [Atomic](https://atomic.io/), [UXPin](https://www.uxpin.com/) or similar. 

For example, taking the Job Story above we might spec out the feature as follows:

```yml
# /features/rain-likelihood.feature
Feature: Rain likelihood for location

  # Job Story
  When I am planning my lunch date, 
  I want to check the likelihood of rain, 
  So I know whether or not to take my jacket

  Scenario: Request rain likelihood
    Given I am signed in
      And I view the main page
      And my location is
        | latitude | longitude  |
        | -42.2865 | 174.7762   | #Wellington
    When I click "Will it rain?"
    Then I see the text "It is likely to rain at your location in the next hour"
```

Let's see how this style of feature specification can clarify its development.

First, the Job Story that the feature targets is written directly into the specification. This helps the team and the client understand how the software achieves the broad goals more specifically. Or at least our assumptions about these.

Second, gherkin syntax is very specific. Does the user need to be signed in? Does the user need to click a button to request forecasts (maybe these should just be displayed by default). Clarifying these states and actions at this stage is much cheaper than re-building features later. 

Third, we see that the feature spec contains some very specific information:
 * The longitude and latitude
 * The text displayed on the button, "Will it rain?"
 * The resulting forecast text, "It is likely to rain at your location in the next hour"

This can help the client and team understand what we need for the feature to work, and the specific content of the page. This feature will likely make use of a weather API which will need the user's location. If we don't have this information currently we'll have to find some way to get it first. 

Sometimes clients leave page content up to the software team and then want it changed later when it doesn't meet their understanding. Also note that the likelihood is expressed in human readable terms "likely to rain". The software team know that the response from a weather API is alomost certainly going to be in percentage terms and transforming this into "likely" or "unlikely" will take additional code.

Note: to get this code to work we're spoofing the browser location `browser.location()`. We'd also have to spoof the Weather API call so that the response is consistent.  

In the later steps we will write code to automate a browser that interacts with our software in the specific way detailed in the specification.


### 3. App scaffolding

The team can begin scaffolding the app, setting up the directory, the testing, build and deployment script etc. We'll need a basic server for our automated browser to interact with.  


### 4. Cucumber automation

At the moment we have some text in a `/features/rain-likelihood.feature` file and you might be wondering how we will program a browser to run the test. This is the magic of cucumber. Cucumber interfaces between readable gherkin specs and less readable browser automation code. We still need to write this code and the following gives an example of the automation code written with [WebDriver](http://webdriver.io/) that drives the feature spec above.

```js
#/features/step_definitions/steps.js

const assert = require('cucumber-assert')
const user = { name: 'Frodo', password: 'the0n3r1ng' }


module.exports = function () {
  
  this.Given('I am signed in', () => {
    browser.url('http://localhost:3000/login')
    browser.setValue('input#username', user.name)
    browser.setValue('input#password', user.password)
    browser.click('button#login')
  })

  this.Given('I view the main page', () => {
    browser.url('http://localhost:3000/')
  })

  this.Given('my location is', table => {
    browser.location(table.hashes()[0])
  })

  this.When('I click "$string"', text => {
    browser.click(`=${text}`)
  })

  this.Then('I see the text "$string"', (text, callback) => {
    browser.waitForExist(`=${text}`, 3000)
    assert.equal(browser.getText(`=${text}`, text, callback)
  })
}
```

A good thing about cucumber steps is that many of them will be reusable in other feature specs. Webdriver has a powerful set of selectors that allow us to select elements based on their text content.  `When I click "$string"` is a generic step that we can reuse in any other feature which involves a user clicking on a button or link.

The above  example code is specific to the Webdriver API and could be written with a different browser automation library.


### 5. Development

We can now start developing our features. With the features spec'd out, developers can estimate their relative complexity. The Client or the Product Owner can prioritise the features they would like developed. As development progresses, a set of passing cucumber specs provide living documentation about what the software can and cannot do. 


### 6. User acceptance tests

When a feature is complete and its cucumber tests pass, the development team can deploy the latest version of the app to a staging server. This allows the client to see a live version of the app and provide feedback and clarifications before features go live on production and the development team to conduct user testing. Near the end of the release cycle the team and the client may sit down and work through the new features on the staging app and their specs before the features are formally accepted.
