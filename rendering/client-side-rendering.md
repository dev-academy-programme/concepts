# Client-side Rendering

The process of client-side rendering is exactly the same as what we experienced on the server. This process includes two components: 

* A template is a file that contains the user interface (HTML) with placeholders and flow control statements (if statements and loops).
* A data object to replace the placeholders in the template.

The main difference between client-side and server-side rendering is how the templates are located. Sometimes the client will need to make an HTTP request to retrieve a template. In server-side rendering they can be easily found on the server.
