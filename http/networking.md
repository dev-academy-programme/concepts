A server is often referred to as the physical or virtual machine. It's what responds when we visit a web site, sending us all the information our browser needs to display the site correctly.

A service:

 - Just an application that runs on a particular computer
 - Listens for requests and then serves responses
 - A web server is a server which serves web pages

Network addresses:

 - Same as IP address
 - An example is 192.168.1.45
 - The address of a computer on a network

Ports: 

 - The particular 'door' at an address.
 - The connection to the application/service, such as HTTP, that is listening for requests.

```
   ip-address   port
         v       v
   192.168.20.30:80
   192.168.20.30:3000
