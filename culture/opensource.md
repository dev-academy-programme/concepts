# Open Source

It's time to give back to the community! Here we present some thoughts designed to guide your first contributions to open source software.

## Be respectful

This should underpin everything you do when working with projects and their maintainers. Remember ***IKE***. These people give much of their time and patience to help their community: don't make their life harder! Say, "thank you".


## Read contribution guidelines and documentation

We can't stress this enough. If you see guidelines, follow them _even if they're different to what you normally do_. If the maintainers want semicolons, use semicolons! If they want nine spaces in every indent, that's up to them. Your job isn't to change their minds and make them see the One True Way to format code.


## Be precise

Your contribution will be examined by others. Make sure you've spell-checked and formatted documentation. Check for broken links. Test code.


## Compare with other contributions

If you're not sure how to format your pull request or issue, look at what others have done. Try to gauge what the minimum standard for contribution is, and exceed it.


## Make sure the tests still pass

If a project has unit tests, _run_ them before submitting your PR. Make sure you didn't break something!


## It's not about you

Sometimes you might get an answer to a question or a pull request that strikes you as abrupt or even rude: chances are, it's not about you. Some projects receive hundreds, even thousands of issues and PRs. The maintainers might just be trying to get through the day as quickly as possible, and sometimes that bleeds out into frustration. Remember, text is low-fidelity communication: maybe some context was lost between the two parties?


## Except maybe when it is about you

Everybody brings something different to a project. Don't be afraid to suggest something new, _especially_ if you can back it up with a contribution (i.e. if you fix the problem you're pointing out).
